## Exercise

On the fourth night, you and your family can't decide which crazy adventure to go on: sailing,
animals reservation, or jet skiing.  You are tasked with creating a program that will decide
which adventure to go on.  Figure out how to create a random number that will pick the different
activities.  So if 1 is picked you go sailing, 2 you go to the animal reservation, and 3 you go jet
skiing. Make the program write to the screen which adventure was chosen.
